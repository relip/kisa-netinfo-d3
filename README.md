KISA-netinfo-d3
============

This is the graph of current internet bandwidth between ISP and IX in South Korea. Original graph is using Flash, so I want to try making a graph with d3.js for better visualization and multi-platform support.
I'm currently learning d3.js, so my code may look dirty. 

Original grapth can be found here: https://ip.kisa.or.kr/etc/netinfo/netinfo.html

ToDo 
-----------

1. Support history feature 
1. Show exact bandwidth
